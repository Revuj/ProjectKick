# Project Kick

### Project
Project Kick is an online platform intended to be used by workers and students alike to manage projects in a fun and user friendly way. To do so, users can create tasks, issues, and deadlines to keep the project running while also keeping a chat system to discuss problems related to the work they are doing in a real time scenario, making Project Kick a very good asset to have while working on a project even with people from different countries. This way we intend to go up against the already established names and leave our mark in the project creation and management branch.
